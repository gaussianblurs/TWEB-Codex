# TWEB/MAC Project

## Subject
A social network to share samples of code between developers.
Each member can share/post short samples of code for other members to copy/paste in their projects.
The members can subscribe to a subject via an # annotation to display related content on their "wall".
They can also search content or members by using this annotation or plain text queries.
Results are then sorted by accuracy and "claps" (a variant of "likes" used by the Medium website).

For example, if a user searches for "react proptypes", a list of code samples featuring
React PropTypes usage, sorted by quality/relevance is returned.

## Resource
The users share Markdown formatted code. They also provide a brief title and description. Additionally, they provide hashtags (#) that describe the content of their publication.
